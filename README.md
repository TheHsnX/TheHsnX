üëÄ About Me
With a strong foundation in cybersecurity and programming, I'm always eager to expand my skills in AI and explore its potential to drive real world impact. I'm a continous learner thriving to grow and collaborate with others to shape a better future. As a computer scientist, AI enthusiast, and a programmer, I'm passionate about using technology to solve complex real problems & improve people's lives.

üå± My Journey
Started with a passion for Video Editing and love for Kdramas... which inspired me to build and manage a ~10K-follower Instagram page. This creative venture (unexpectedly) introduced me to Cybersecurity, where I dove deep into understanding digital safety. After navigating the 'lion's den' in cyber world firsthand, I pivoted towards a safer and equally thrilling frontier: ‚ÄîArtificial Intelligence‚Äî Here, I find joy in crafting tools that empower, rather than expose!

Driven by AI's rapid advancements, I've a strong affinity for Generative AI & Data Analytics, and I'm continuously expanding my expertise in these areas. While I‚Äôm still discovering where exactly I belong in this ever evolving landscape, my true passions lie somewhere at the intersection of artificial intelligence, cybersecurity, and web development :)
